         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And long I ſate downe, and waited for the undertaking of ſome abler pen; but ſeeing ſuch a ſilence in ſo needfull a ſubject, as one that might not be too long wanting either to the vindication of the common cauſe, or the ſafety of my owne charge, I have thus boldly ruſhed forth into the Preſse.</p>
            <p>I cannot be ſo weakly inconſiderate, as to think that I could put my finger into this fire, and not be ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I doe well know, never any man toucht upon this quarrell, who was not branded with the deepeſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Yet I do willingly ſacrifice my ſelf herein to God and his Truth.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe my heart burnes within mee to ſee a righteous cauſe thus martyred through unjuſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and to ſee ſome honest and well-minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians miſled into a palpable error under the pretence
<pb facs="tcp:176655:3"/> of zeale and piety, by the meere names of two or three late Authors, not more learned and godly, than (in this point) groſsely miſtaken.</p>
            <p>If your Majeſties great Cares of State could part with ſo much leiſure as to peruſe this ſhort, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full relation of the first ground, and originall of this unhappie diviſion in the Church, it might pleaſe your Majeſtie to be informed, that when <hi>Petrus Balma,</hi> the laſt Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> was by his mutining Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens frighted, and driven out of his place, and that Church was now left headleſſe: <hi>Farell,</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> two zealous Preachers there, deviſed, and ſet up a new platforme of Church-Government never before heard of in the Christian World; Themſelves would ſupply the Biſhop; and certaine Burgeſſes of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ſupply his aſsiſtant Clergie; and both theſe together would make up the body of an Eccleſiaſticall Senate or Conſiſtorie. This ſtrange bird thus hatched by <hi>Farell,</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> was afterwards brooded by two more famous ſucceſſours; and all this within the compaſſe of our preſent age. Now, had this forme (being at firſt deviſed only out of need for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhift) contained it ſelfe within the compaſſe of the bankes of the Lemane lake, it might have beene there retained, with either the connivence, or pitie of the reſt of the Chriſtian world: but now finding
<pb facs="tcp:176655:4"/> it ſelfe to grow in ſome places, through the fame of the abettors, into requeſt, and good ſucceſſe; it hath taken the boldneſſe to put it ſelfe forth to the notice and approbation of ſome neighbour Churches; and ſome there are (which I bleſſe my ſelfe to ſee) that have taken ſuch liking to it, that they have affected a voluntary conformity thereunto: and being weary of that old form of Adminiſtration, which hath (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction) continued in the whole Christian Church from the times of the bleſſed Apostles of Chriſt incluſively untill this preſent age, are not onely eager (out of their credulity) to erect this new frame, but dare venditate it to the world, after fifteene hundred yeares deep ſilence, for the very Ordinance, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt; whereas, if any living man can ſhew any one lay Presbyter, that ever was in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, till <hi>Farell</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> firſt created him, let me forfeit my reputation to ſhame, and my life to juſtice. This is the true ground of this wofull quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; wherein I cannot but heartily pitie the miſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of many well-meaning ſoules, of your Majeſties ſubjects, which are impetuouſly carried away in the throng, by the meere ſway of names, and tyrannie of an ignorant zeale; not being ſo much as ſuffered to know where they are, or on what ground they goe: the fervent deſire of whoſe reclamation, as of the
<pb facs="tcp:176655:4"/> ſettlement of others, whom the ill condition of the time might cauſe to ſtagger, hath put my pen upon this envious, but neceſſarie taske; whereto alſo my zeale was the more ſtirred, by an information, which I received from the late meeting at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> In the eight Seſsion whereof it is reported, that one <hi>M. G. Grahame</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orkney</hi> had openly, before the whole body of the Aſſembly, renounced his Epiſcopall Function, and craved pardon for having accepted it, as if thereby he had committed ſome hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence; this uncouth act of his was more than enough to inflame any dutifull ſon of the Church, and to occaſion this my enſuing (moſt juſt) expostulation. Only I had need to crave pardon of your Majeſtie for the boldneſse of this interpellation, that I have dared to move your Majeſtie to deſcend ſo low, as to take view of this (on my part, ſo confidently undertaken) duell; Although, if the Combatants be ſingle, yet the Cauſe is ſo common, as that the whole Church of God claimes her intereſt in it; But your Majeſties long-knowne goodneſſe incourages me to this preſumption; And withall, I could not but have ſome due regard to that right, and propriety, which your Majeſtie may juſtly challenge in all the labours of this kinde, from whoſe pen ſoever, as being under God appointed the great Patron of all divine truths, the great Guardian
<pb facs="tcp:176655:5"/> and Protector of theſe parts of his Church upon earth, whoſe true, ancient, and Apoſtolicall government is here queſtioned, and whoſe deſerved devotions, and faithfull prayers ſhal be continually powred out to the God of heaven, for your Majeſties long and happy preſervation, amongſt which ſhall be duly paid the daily tribute of</p>

How wearie ſhould I be of this Rochet, if you can ſhew me, that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie is of any leſſe than divine Inſtitution. The eminence of that calling, which you have given up, as too good for you, will not allow you (though perhaps you might) to plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Win him by your powerfull arguments, who is ſo far from being wedded to the love of this miſconceived pomp, that he envies the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſweet peace of his inferiours; Let me tell you, it is your perſon, that aggravates your crime; For a ſheep to ſtray, it is no wonder; but for a Shepheard, yea a guide and director of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, (ſuch God and the Church had made you) not to wander himſelfe only, but to lead away his flock from the green paſtures,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176655:10"/> and comfortable waters of divine Truth, to the drie and barren deſarts of humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it cannot be but as ſhamefull as it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; both in an high degree. That ſome poore ſeduced ſoules of your ignorant vulgar ſhould condemne that calling, which they were never ſuffered to looke at, but with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate eyes; or, that ſome of your higher-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Clergie, out of an Ambition of this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and anger of the repulſe, ſhould ſnarle at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> this denied honour; or, that ſome of your great ones, who, perhaps, do no leſſe love the lands, than they envie, and hate the preheminence of Biſhops, ſhould crie downe that ſacred functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, could be no other than might in times ſo conditioned be expected, and by fore-expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made the more tolerable: But for a man held, once, worthy to be graced with the chair of <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> to ſpurne downe that once ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſeat, and to make his very Profeſsion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a ſin, is ſo ſhamefull an indignity, as the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of the ſucceeding ages, will ſhake their heads at, and not mention, without juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. If you were guilty, to your ſelfe, of any noted perſonall exorbitances, or of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, or offenſive miſcariages in your ill-placed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176655:10"/> government (ſuch perhaps, as have inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged your angry vulgar) theſe had beene juſt matter of your humble penitence, and worthy of your moſt ſubmiſſe deprecation: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you of a moſt lawfull, honourable, holy, divine vocation, and thereby to caſt mire in the faces of the bleſſed Apoſtles, who received it from their God, and Saviour, and by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Spirit ordained it, is ſuch an act, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as can ſcarce be expiated with floods of over-lateſt teares.

It is true, many Biſhops have beene faultie in their owne perſons, and condemned too juſtly of exorbitance, in managing their calling; but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176655:11"/> where the calling is (as it ſhould be) ſevered from theſe exceptions to the perſon, did ever any wiſe man, or Chriſtian Church condemn that calling for it ſelfe? Yea, if the laſt Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> had become a Proteſtant, aad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in matter of Doctrine to <hi>Calvin, Farret, Viret,</hi> have you or any man living juſt cauſe to think that the Citie would not gladly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his government ſtill, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> happy under ſuch a protection? would they have ejected him as an enemy, whom they might have enjoyed as a Patron? Would they have ſtood upon his Epiſcopacie, whiles they had his concurrence in the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?

This was their Caſe, but what is this to yours? Your Church was happily gone out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; your and our moſt gracious and religious Soveraigne ſincerely profeſſeth, maintaineth, incourageth the bleſſedly-reformed Religion,

               <p>Neither is there a more ſenſible difference betweene the Authority and ſucceſſe of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall or popular Reformation, than there is betweene the forms which are fit and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for large Churches living under the ſway of a Monarch, and thoſe which particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or territories may admit under a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> or Ariſtocraticall government: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (ſaith the Reformed Politique diſcreetly) I do inferre, that in the ſtate of a mighty and peaceable Church, as that of <hi>England,</hi> or as the Church of <hi>France,</hi> or ſuch like, might be, if God ſhould call them to Reformation, the ſtate of the Clergie ought to be preſerved; For equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be hurtfull to the State, and in time breed confuſion.

And indeed (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe holy and divine conſiderations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> whereof we ſhall treat in the ſequell) it ſtands with great reaſon, that there ſhould be a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence betwixt the Church, and the State, and a meet reſpect to the rules of both.

But of this point more elſewhere. My zeal,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176655:21"/> and my reſpects to the Churches abroad, and my care and pitie of many ſeduced ſoules at home, have drawne me on farther in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, than I meant: For who can indure to ſee ſimple and well meaning Chriſtians abuſed with the falſe colour of Conformity with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, when there is apparently more diſtance in the ground of their differences, than in the places of their ſituation? Be wiſe, my deare Brethren, and ſuffer not your ſelves to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> be cheated of the Truth, by the miſ-zealous ſuggeſtions of partiall-teachers.

For now that I have got you alone, I ſhall be bold to take you to task, and doe, in the name of Almighty God, vehemently urge, and challenge you to maintaine (if by any skill or pretence you may) your owne act of the condemnation

Or will any man forbid us to appeale from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176655:39"/> them? Bleſſed God! that any who beares the title of a Chriſtian, ſhould have the forehead thus to argue: Appeale? To whom I pray? To the ſucceeding Doctors and Fathers? No, they were in the ſame predicament; to the reſt of the whole Church? They were governed by theſe leaders; whither therefore can they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to appeale, but to themſelves? and what proves this then, but their owne caſe? And if the Fathers may not be ſuffered to be our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> will it not become the houſe well, that theſe men ſhould now be the Fathers Iudges?</p>
               <p>But the Fathers were Biſhops; the caſe was their owne; true, they were Biſhops; and it is our glory and comfort, that we have had ſuch predeceſſours: In vaine ſhould we affect to be more holy and more happy than they; Let them, if they can, produce ſuch preſidents of their parity. But, the caſe was theirs.

               <p>EIghthly, I muſt challenge it for an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> truth, that thoſe men, whom the ancient Church of God, and the holy and Orthodoxe Fathers have condemned for erroneous and hereticall, are not fit to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of us, as the Authours of our opinion or practice for the government of the Church, in thoſe points for which they were cenſured.

Now if any man ſhall think fit to pitch upon the noted miſ-opinions of the holieſt authors, for imitation or maintenance, what can we eſteeme of him, but as the flye, who, paſsing by the ſound parts of the skin, fals upon a raw and ulcered ſore: And if the beſt Saints may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> not be followed in their faults, how much leſſe may we make choice of the examples, or judgements of thoſe, who are juſtly branded by the whole Church for ſchiſme or hereſie?

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176655:41"/> ſubſtance of a lawfull and holy calling: Theſe things, being meerely externall, and adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, can no more alter the nature of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than change of ſuits, the body. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it otherwiſe with the calling, than with the perſon whoſe it is; The man is the ſame whether poore or rich; The good <hi>Patriarch</hi> was the ſame in <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s dungeon, and on <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s bench; Our <hi>Saviour</hi> was the ſame in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:176655:42"/> ſome garments be courſe, yet they may ſerve to defend from cold; others, beſides warmth, give grace and comelineſſe to the body; there may be good uſe of both; and perhaps one and the ſame veſture may ſerve for both purpoſes. It is an old and ſure rule in Philoſophie, That degrees do not diverſifie the kinds of things; The ſame fire that flaſhes in the Tow, glowes in the Iuniper; if one gold be finer than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both are gold; if ſome pearles be fairer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> than other, yet their kinde is the ſame; neither is it otherwiſe in callings and profeſſions.

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> TEnthly, It cannot but be granted, That thoſe paſſages of holy Scriptures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any forme of government (different from the anciently received and eſtabliſhed) is pretended to be grounded, had need to be very cleare and unqueſtionable; and more evident and convictive than thoſe, whereon the former (now rejected) policy was raiſed: For, if only Scripture muſt decide this queſtion; and no other, either evidence or judgment will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted beſides it; And if withall there be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> concerning the ſenſe of the texts on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſides alledged; it muſt needs follow, that the clearer Scriptures muſt carry it, and give light to the more obſcure: we are wont to ſay, that poſſeſſion is eleven points of the Law; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where that is had, and hath long been held,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:176655:43"/> it is fit there ſhould be a legall ejection, and that ejection muſt bee upon better evidence of right; If therefore the Church of God have beene quietly poſſeſſed of this government by Biſhops, for above theſe ſixteene hundred yeares, it is good reaſon the ejectors ſhould ſhow better proofe than the ancient poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, ere they be outed from their Tenures: And what better proofe can there be than more cleare Scripture? Shortly then, if it ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> bee made to appeare, that the Scriptures brought for a lay-Presbytery are few, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, litigious, full of diverſe and uncertaine ſenſes, and ſuch as many and much clearer places ſhall plainely ſhow to be otherwiſe meant by the Holy Ghoſt, than theſe new maiſters apply them: then it cannot be denied, that the lay-Presbytery hath no true footing in the Word of God, and that the old forme of Adminiſtration in an imparity of Miniſters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ought onely to be continued in the Church.</p>

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ELeventhly, I may well take it for granted, neither can it reaſonably be denied, that, if the Order which they ſay Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſet for the government of his Church (which they call the Kingdome and Ordinance of Chriſt) be but one, and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and undoubted, then certainly it muſt, and ſhould, and would have beene, ere this, agreed upon by the abettors of it, what, and which it is.

               <p>TWelfthly, It muſt be yeelded, that if this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which they call for, be the Kingdome and Ordinance of Chriſt, then it ought to be erected and maintained in all Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtians all the world over; And that where any eſſentiall part thereof is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there the Kingdome of Chriſt is not

               <p>It is yielded by the wiſer fautors of Diſcipline, that there is a certain Polity neceſſary for the retention of the Churches peace; That this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity requires that there muſt be ſeverall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or flocks of Chriſtians, and that every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> flock ſhould have his own Shepherd; That ſince thoſe guides of Gods people are ſubject to error in Doctrine and exorbitance in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which may need correction and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and many doubtfull caſes may fall out, which will need deciſion, it is requiſite there ſhould be ſome further aid, given by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and aſsiſtance of other Paſtors; That thoſe Paſtors, met together in Claſſes and Synodes, are fit arbiters in differences, and cenſurers of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> errors and diſorders. That in Synodes thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled there muſt be due order kept; That or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot be kept, where there is an abſolute equality of all perſons convened: That it is therefore neceſſary that there ſhould be an head, Preſident, or Governour of the aſſembly, who ſhall marſhall all the affairs of thoſe mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,

This then was the Apoſtles courſe, for the plantation of the Church, and the better propagation of the Goſpel, where ever they came, they found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ordain meet aſsiſtants to them, and they promiſcuouſly imparted unto them all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their owne ſtile (but Apoſtolicall) naming them Biſhops and Presbyters, and Deacons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the familiarity and indifferency of their former uſage therein: But when they, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divided themſelves into ſeverall parts of the world, found that the number of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (eſpecially in the greater Cities) ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,

It is imputed to the Angell of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that however him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his own perſon, held conſtant to the Faith, yet that there were thoſe under his charge, who held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> the beaſtly errours of the Nicolaitans; lhey were

               <p>And more plainly; the Angell of the Church of <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> notwithſtanding all his good parts, graces, ſervices, is ſharply taxed: What is his fault?<note place="margin">Revel. 2.26.</note> That thou ſuffereſt the woman <hi>Iezabel</hi> (who calleth herſelf a propheteſſe) to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> teach and ſeduce my ſervants, &amp;c.

The receiving of Infants to holy Baptiſme is a matter of ſo high conſequence, that we juſtly Brand our Catabaptiſts with hereſie, for denying it; yet, Let me with good aſſurance ſay that the evidences, for this truth, come farre ſhort of that, which the Scriptures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> have afforded us for the ſuperiority of ſome Church-governors over thoſe, who otherwiſe indeed, in a ſole reſpect of their miniſteriall function, are equall.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:176655:89"/> and if this be no rule no Juriſdiction, we claim none.</p>
               <p>Certainly, no wit of man can deviſe any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion here, but by exception at the credit of the Evidence; Loud clamours are raiſed of their Counterfayſance; Rather than fail, Pope <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> himſelf is brought in to diſprove theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, as Apocryphall; And they that do moſt eagarly cry the Pope down, for the Antichriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> are readieſt to plead his authority againſt their brethren: Not conſidering the Pope herein <hi>(Vafer Afer)</hi> as <hi>Fregevill</hi> juſtly calls him, drave his own Plough; for nothing could more cut him in the affectation of his Supremacy, than thoſe <hi>Canons,</hi> which therefore it is no marvell if he diſparage.

               <p>WE have ſeen the grounds of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> laid by our Saviour himſelf in imparity: We have ſeen it ſo built up by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike hands; we have ſeen the practiſe of the ancient and ſubſequent Church, laying on the roof to make a perfect Fabrick; Yet what is all this, if the charge be not univerſall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall? yeild it to be ſo ancient as the Apoſtles themſelves; yet if it be arbitrary, whether for time or place, what have we gained? Surely as God is but one, and ever himſelf, ſo would he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> have his Church. There may be threeſcore Queens, and fourſcore Concubins, and Virgins without number; but his Dove, his undefiled is but one; and though ſhe may go in ſeverall dreſſes and trimmings, yet ſtill and ever the ſtuffe is the ſame. Plainly, though there may be varieties of circumſtantiall faſhons in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:176655:113"/> Churches, yet the ſubſtance of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is, and muſt be ever the ſame. That ordinary power which the Apoſtles had, they traduced to their ſucceſſors, as bequeathed by our Saviour, in his laſt fare well to them unto the end of the world. For we may not think, as one ſaid well, that the Apoſtles carried their Commiſſion with them up to heaven. They knew it was given them for a perpetuity of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſucceſſion. He that ſaid, <hi>Go teach all Nations, and baptize,</hi> added, <hi>Behold I am with you to the end of the world;</hi> He could not mean it of their perſons which ſtaid not long upon earth after him; he meant it of their Evangelical ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; So was he with them; as he was with his domeſticks their Predeceſſors, not in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatneſſe and extraordinary way of calling; not in the admirable meaſure and kinds of their <gap reason="foreign">

Such were the preaching of the Goſpell, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, the ordaining Church-officers, the ordering of Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:176655:113"/> the infliction of cenſures, and, in ſhort, the power of the Keys, which we juſtly ſay, were not tyed to St. <hi>Peters</hi> girdle, but were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to all his fellows, and to all his and their ſucceſſors for ever. By vertue whereof, all true Paſtors can open and ſhut heaven gates above, much more the Church doors hereupon earth: And all theſe as are of ſuch neceſſity, that without them the Church could not at all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſubſiſt; at leaſt, not long and in any tolerable Condition. The power of theſe acts, as it was by our Saviours Commiſſion, originally in the Apoſtles, being by them conveyed to the Church, and not by the Church conveyed to them; So it ſucceeded accordingly in, and to their ſucceſſors and was incorporated into their office; we that are Prieſts receive the Keys in <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe) Veniat ad Antiſtites,</hi>

And if this power and this charge, were by the very hands of the Apoſtles, entayled upon theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent perſons, which ſhould by due ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein ſucceed them, and from them line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> deſcend upon us, I wonder what humane power dare preſume to cut it off. Neither do I leſſe marvell at the opinions of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which holding Epiſcopacy thus to ſtand <hi>Jure Apoſtolico,</hi> in the firſt inſtitution, yet hold it may be changed in the ſequel. For me I have learned to yeild this honour to theſe inſpired
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:176655:114"/> men, that I dare not but think theſe their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which they intended to ſucceſſion; immutable. Some kinds of Ceremonious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions fell from them, which were meant to be only locall, and temporary; thoſe we have no reaſon to think our ſelves oblieged to, but thoſe which they left for the adminiſtration of Gods Church, it ſhall be high preſumption in any to alter: becauſe the Apoſtles did but meet together divers times, on the firſt day of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="01"/> week; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ordered that day for the laying aſide their Collections; And that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Lords day by the Apoſtle; How ſtrongly are the vehement oppoſites of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, wont to maintain that day, in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Jewiſh Sabbath; and that in all points unalterable, by any humane authority? Surely had they but the tenth part of that plea from the Apoſtles, for this their Judaicall-Evangelicall Sabbath, which we have for our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Epiſcopacy, they would make us feel the Dint of this argument, and would in the rigorous obſervation of it, out-do the Jews: But you are now ready to choak me with ſome Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ordinances, which were even of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> emſelves reverſed. Be it ſo: Then you tell me of the firſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:176655:115"/> form of their goverment of the Church, which (ſay you) was by an equality from: which, if (as we plead) they afterwards aſcended to this imparity (which we now contend for) why is it not as ſafe ſay you, for us to take up that their firſt form, as this latter. Admitting all this, our anſwer is the readier; we like well to make thoſe holy men of God our chooſers: They thought fit to alter to this: and therefore we think fit to hold to it: They tryed both, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and left this to be continued. The truth is, the Church of God at the very firſt, was only in framing, and not all of a ſuddain framed; In framing thereof, as the equality among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the fulneſſe of Grace which they all had) conduced to that work; ſo all that while, for the better promoting of the ſame work, they themſelves maintained their own ſuperiority and power over other Presbyters: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> So then the change being made by the Apoſtles themſelves, and not by other; they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly guided by the Spirit of God, though they changed, we may not; Nay, becauſe they changed, we may not; the holy Ghoſt led them unto it; and therefore we, unleſſe we will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ordinance of the holy Ghoſt, muſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:176655:115"/> not detrect to continue it. Otherwiſe, why may I not urge the ſame argument in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced Sabbath, The Apoſtles had duly kept the ſeaventh day according to the Law; they after fell to the obſervation of the firſt day.

Deare Chriſtians, I hope, you now believe it; that the very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves, who lived to ſee and act the eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacie, would betray the Church, at their parting, to that man of ſin: That all the holy Fathers and Martyrs of the Primitive Church, were either, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or will, guilty of this ſacrilegious treachery; that all the eyes of the whole world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> were blind, till this City (which was once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed dedicated to the Sun, and beares it ſtill for her emblem) inlightened them; and if ye can believe theſe ſtrange ſuggeſters, wonder ye at them, whiles I doe no leſſe wonder at you.</p>
